Write a trinomial tree program to price a down-and-out barrier call. Inputs: (1) S (stock price), (2) K (strike price), (3) r (interest rate), (4) s (annual volatility), (5) T (time to maturity in years), (6) H (barrier), and (7) n (number of time steps). Output: Option price. For example, suppose that S = 95, K = 100, r = 10 (%), s = 25 (%), H = 90, and T = 1. The option price is about 5.9899 at n = 75 and 5.9977 at n = 400. IMPORTANT notes: (1) The interest rate and volatility should be in percent. For example, if the interest rate is 5% and volatility 30%, the inputs are 5 and 30, respectively. (2) The trinomial tree must matches the barrier.
