Implement the Least Square Monte Carlo method to price an American option. Use 1, x, x2, x3 as the basis functions. (1) S (stock price), (2) K (strike price), (3) r (interest rate), (4) s (volatility), (5) T (time to maturity in years), (6) n (number of time steps), (7) N (number of simulation paths). Output: Option price and the standand error. IMPORTANT notes: (1) The interest rate and volatility should be in percent. For example, if the interest rate is 1% and volatility 10%, the inputs are 1 and 10, respectively.
